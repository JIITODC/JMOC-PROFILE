# Results (JMoC 2019)

Congratulations to all the participants. A lot of thanks to the mentors for making this event possible.

We feel ecstatic to inform that this event was a huge success. This is the very first event of JODC organized at this level. We received 63 mentor applications and 319 student applications at the beginning of this event. Out of that 43 projects were selected for the coding period and all the students, who applied, were allowed to contribute. 

At the end of the month, we are in the position to announce top-performing students and the students who successfully passed the final evaluation. The results are totally based on the contributions reflected by their GitHub profile and the feedback submitted by their mentors.

But most importantly, we would like to congratulate all the students who participated. They all have achieved something more than others. We hope to see you again at JMoC 2020.
